# Hi there! My name is Công 👋

I've been working as a software engineer on Embedded System over 5 years. It's not too long to said that I'm a senior in this field. I'm still learning and trying to do better each day. And I think sharing also is a good way to improve not only me, but also for people.

My blogs delve into C/C++, operating systems, and networking, while also covering good practices, design patterns, and debugging techniques relevant to embedded system developments. I hope you learn something valuable or simply enjoy your time reading my blog 😛.

Feel free to contact to me if you have any questions or want to share your opinions. Always want to chat 😎

Welcome your feedback and ideas!
