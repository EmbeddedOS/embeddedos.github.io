## 1. Let's talk efficiency

In software development, using qualitative words is not always a good choice. Sayings such as *it's awesome, I promise it will run very fast*, *it's very efficient and stable, high performance*, etc. That sounds good, but in the end, what does that actually mean? or how we prove that? Your customers, recruiters, or managers can't count on those things to decide to buy your products, hiring, or promote you. They need the real things! and that is the target of this article.

By measuring your programs, you do know is this actually effective? does your program run fast, and the most important your effort can be count! for example, now you can report to your boss, *hey men, I do optimize my function and it run faster 40%!* Big change, right?
