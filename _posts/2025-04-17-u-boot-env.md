## 1. Objective

- Understand u-boot booting environment.
- How the variables are load/store and what are they used for.
- Using QEMU to demonstrate bootflow.

## 2. Environment variables

U-Boot uses environment variables to keep the source code as generic as possible. These environment can be stored in several locations, depends on building configuration.

- NOR/NAND flash memory.
- eMMC/SD card.
- SPI flash.
- EEPROM.
- RAM.
- Or ENV in the boot FAT/ext4 filesystem.

The location is defined at the config file, for example, `qemu_arm64_defconfig`:

```text
# CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_EEPROM is not set
# CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_FAT is not set
# CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_EXT4 is not set
CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_FLASH=y
# CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_NAND is not set
# CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_NVRAM is not set
# CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_REMOTE is not set
```

The config file also tell u-boot how to loads these variables:

```text
CONFIG_ENV_SOURCE_FILE=""
CONFIG_ENV_SIZE=0x40000
CONFIG_ENV_SECT_SIZE=0x40000
CONFIG_ENV_ADDR=0x4000000
```

You can also load env variables at runtime by using `setenv`, `printenv` commands, and `env_get()`, `env_set()`, `saveenv()` in C.

### 2.1. Environment variable purposes

U-Boot support variety kind of booting. These environment variables are used to control boot behavior: how the system boots, what it boots, and where from.

### 2.2. Boot configuration

`bootcmd` is used to store boot commands that are run if the user does not enter the shell. This example load kernel image from mmc device 0, partition 1 and then call `bootz` to boot kernel with fdt address:

```text
setenv boot_linux 'ext4load mmc 0:1 ${kernel_addr_r} /boot/zImage; bootz ${kernel_addr_r} - ${fdt_addr_r}'
setenv bootcmd 'run boot_linux'
```

`bootargs` is used to specify kernel command line.

`boot_targets` this variable list devices to scan, used by `bootflow` command to specify list of device and order to scan.

### 2.3. Kernel/image locations

- `kernel_addr_r`, `fdt_addr_r`, `ramdisk_addr_r` -- RAM addresses to load kernel, DTB, and initrd.
- `kernel_addr`, `fdt_addr`, `ramdisk_addr` -- Flash locations that kernel, DTB, and initrd are stored.
- `*_high` -- restrict positioning of images.

For example:

```text
fdt_addr=0x40000000
fdt_high=0xffffffff
initrd_high=0xffffffff
kernel_addr_r=0x40400000
loadaddr=0x40200000
pxefile_addr_r=0x40300000
ramdisk_addr_r=0x44000000
scriptaddr=0x40200000
```

### 2.4. Device/Filesystem booting

- `root`, `mmcdev`, `mmcroot`, `mmcpart` -- Define rootfs location and MMC partition.
- `ethaddr`, `ipaddr`, `serverip` -- Used for network booting (e.g., TFTP, NFS).

### 2.5. hardware configuration

- `baudrate`, `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr` -- Serial console settings.
- `ethaddr` -- MAC address.
- `serial#` -- Device serial number.

## 3. Store/Load environment variables

There are some ways to store/load these variables:

- Built-in the u-boot binary.
- Get from memory devices.
- Get from an environment file that is stored in the filesystem.

### 3.1. Built-in default variables

The default environment variables are define in this file `include/env_default.h`. Some are get from the `.config` file:

```c
char default_environment[] = {
#ifdef CONFIG_USE_BOOTARGS
  "bootargs=" CONFIG_BOOTARGS "\0"
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_BOOTCOMMAND
  "bootcmd=" CONFIG_BOOTCOMMAND "\0"
#endif
  /* ... */
}
```

Specific additional board configurations are defined at `include/<board>.h`, for example `include/pxa1908.h`:

```c
#define CFG_SYS_SDRAM_BASE      0x1000000
#define CFG_SYS_INIT_RAM_ADDR   0x10000000
#define CFG_SYS_INIT_RAM_SIZE   0x4000
#define CFG_SYS_NS16550_IER     0x40
#define CFG_SYS_BAUDRATE_TABLE  { 115200, 230400, 460800, 921600 }
#define CFG_EXTRA_ENV_SETTINGS "bootcmd=bootm $prevbl_initrd_start_addr\0"
```

Some variables are defined in specify board environment file `board/<vendor>/<board>/<board>.env` . When building the target, u-boot generate variables from that file into the macro `CONFIG_EXTRA_ENV_TEXT` and then adding them into the `default_environment` array:

```c
char default_environment[] = {
  /* ... */
#ifdef CONFIG_EXTRA_ENV_TEXT
  /* This is created in the Makefile */
  CONFIG_EXTRA_ENV_TEXT
#endif
/* ... */
}
```

For example, `qemu-arm` architecture has defined the `board/emulation/qemu-arm/qemu-arm.env`:

```text
/* SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0+ */

/* environment for qemu-arm and qemu-arm64 */

stdin=serial,usbkbd
stdout=serial,vidconsole
stderr=serial,vidconsole
fdt_high=0xffffffff
initrd_high=0xffffffff
fdt_addr=0x40000000
scriptaddr=0x40200000
pxefile_addr_r=0x40300000
kernel_addr_r=0x40400000
ramdisk_addr_r=0x44000000
boot_targets=qfw usb scsi virtio nvme dhcp
```

That and then is defined into C macro, generated in the file `include/generated/environment.h`:

```c
#define CONFIG_EXTRA_ENV_TEXT "boot_targets=qfw usb scsi virtio nvme dhcp\0fdt_addr=0x40000000\0fdt_high=0xffffffff\0initrd_high=0xffffffff\0kernel_addr_r=0x40400000\0pxefile_addr_r=0x40300000\0ramdisk_addr_r=0x44000000\0scriptaddr=0x40200000\0stderr=serial,vidconsole\0stdin=serial,usbkbd\0stdout=serial,vidconsole\0"
```

### 3.2. Variables stored in memory devices

Sometimes variables can be stored on non-volatile store device. And the offsets to query them are enabled at compile time. For example, the variables can be stored at a well-known block in MMC, or a fixed memory in flash. To load them from a storage device, we must enable the corresponding config, the offset and the size configuration also. For example, we spend flash memory address from 0x04000000 to `0x04400000` to store u-boot variables:

```text
CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_FLASH=y
CONFIG_ENV_ADDR=0x4000000
CONFIG_ENV_SIZE=0x40000
```

### 3.3. Environment files

Sometimes it's hard to change these variables if they're stored in the binary itself or in the memory raw, we need some extra tools to access them. U-Boot provides an other way to make the change much easier, get these environment variables from a file that is stored in the filesystem.

Currently, uboot supports getting environment files from 2 filesystem types: fat and ext4. The environment file name, by default, is `/uboot.env`. Here is an example of getting environment file from a mmc device 0, ext4 partition 1.

```text
CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_EXT4=y
CONFIG_ENV_EXT4_FILE="/my-env.env"
CONFIG_ENV_EXT4_INTERFACE="mmc"
CONFIG_ENV_EXT4_DEVICE_AND_PART="0:1"
```

> If the environment is get from a file, some default variables might be ignored.
{: .prompt-warn }
> If your storage device requires device driver or bus that are initialized later, u-boot can not load the env file in early stage. For example, your device is an USB storage device that connect to AHCI bus U-boot can not load the file from them.
{: .prompt-warn }

## 4. Booting system

By default, if the user don't enter shell, uboot read the `bootcmd` to perform booting. There several methods to boot:

- `boot` -- Boot default, i.e., run 'bootcmd'.
- `bootd` -- Boot default, i.e., run 'bootcmd'.
- `bootdev` -- Boot devices.
- `bootefi`-- Boots an EFI payload from memory.
- `bootelf`-- Boot from an ELF image in memory.
- `bootflow` -- Boot flows.
- `booti` -- Boot Linux kernel 'Image' format from memory.
- `bootm` -- Boot application image from memory.
- `bootmeth` -- Boot methods.
- `bootp` -- Boot image via network using BOOTP/TFTP protocol.
- `bootstd` -- Standard-boot operation.
- `bootvx` -- Boot vxWorks from an ELF image.
- `bootz` -- Boot Linux zImage image from memory.

### 4.1. `bootflow` method

This method is one of the newest introduced in newer U-boot versions. It's used for:

- Auto-discovering bootable devices and partitions.
- Automatically finding boot scripts, kernel image, and dtb.
- Generic booting method across platforms.

```bash
=> help bootflow
bootflow - Boot flows

Usage:
bootflow scan [-abeGl] [bdev]  - scan for valid bootflows (-l list, -a all, -e errors, -b boot, -G no global)
bootflow list [-e]             - list scanned bootflows (-e errors)
bootflow select [<num>|<name>] - select a bootflow
bootflow info [-ds]            - show info on current bootflow (-d dump bootflow)
bootflow read                  - read all current-bootflow files
bootflow boot                  - boot current bootflow
bootflow menu [-t]             - show a menu of available bootflows
bootflow cmdline [set|get|clear|delete|auto] <param> [<value>] - update cmdline
```

This command read the variable `boot_targets` for list of devices. Some way to boot:

- `bootflow scan -b` -- Scan in the list, and boot if meet the first bootable one.
- `bootflow select  [<num>|<name>]` -- select device to boot and then boot with `bootflow boot`.

For example, simple setup that scan the list `qfw usb scsi virtio nvme dhcp` in order and perform booting:

```text
boot_targets=qfw usb scsi virtio nvme dhcp
bootcmd=bootflow scan -lb
```

> `qfw` is QEMU firmware information command, only supported when running on QEMU.
{: .prompt-info }

### 4.2. Boot configuration files

The standard format for boot configuration files is that of `extlinux.conf`, as handled by U-Boot's `syslinux` (disk) or `pxe boot` (network).

The boot method with extlinux is enabled by `CONFIG_BOOTMETH_EXTLINUX=y`. U-boot scans the device list in `boot_targets` one by one and looking for the configure file `/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf`. It then try to parse the config files and load images, if some error occurs, u-boot scans for the next device.

#### 4.2.1. `extlinux.conf` format

This file follow the syslinux format that contains boot information and:

- Kernel image.
- Device Tree.
- Initrd.
- Kernel command lines.

```text
DEFAULT linux
TIMEOUT 5

LABEL linux
  KERNEL /boot/vmlinuz
  INITRD /boot/initrd.img
  APPEND root=/dev/sda1 quiet
```

### 4.3. Booting with EFI

When built with EFI support, U-Boot acts like a UEFI firmware (For more detail about EFI, visit this blog [Bootloader UEFI](/posts/Build-A-x86-Bootloader-UEFI/)):

- Start and initializes devices (mmc, usb, virtio, etc.).
- Scan for ESP partition.
- Try to run `EFI/BOOT/BOOTAA64.EFI` (file name depends on architecture).
- The bootloader and then taking care all the rest.

For example:

```bash
fatload mmc 0:1 ${loadaddr} /EFI/BOOT/BOOTAA64.EFI
bootefi ${loadaddr} $fdtcontroladdr
```

Or Let u-boot automatically use EFI bootmgr:

```bash
bootefi bootmgr
```

## 5. U-boot emulation with QEMU

U-boot has supported QEMU platform for some architectures (x86, arm, risc, etc). To test loading environment variables we will run u-boot with qemu, emulate a block device and let's the u-boot take the environment file from that. First let's build u-boot from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot
make -j$(nproc) ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=<toolchain_prefix_path> qemu_arm64_defconfig
```

We get the default configuration for `qemu_arm64_defconfig`, assume that our block device is a virtio device, and we make a ext4 partition on that. So There are some configurations need to change:

```text
CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_EXT4=y
CONFIG_ENV_EXT4_INTERFACE="virtio"
CONFIG_ENV_EXT4_DEVICE_AND_PART="0:0"
CONFIG_ENV_EXT4_FILE="/my-uboot.env"
```

`CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_EXT4=y` enable loading environment from an ext4 partition, the device interface is `virtio`, the device number is 0, the partition index is 0, and we want to read `/my-uboot.env` as a environment file. If you want to change the built-in variables. Make the change in `board/emulation/qemu-arm/qemu-arm.env`, for example, adding one more variable `our_var=test`:

```text
/* SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0+ */

/* environment for qemu-arm and qemu-arm64 */

stdin=serial,usbkbd
stdout=serial,vidconsole
stderr=serial,vidconsole
fdt_high=0xffffffff
initrd_high=0xffffffff
fdt_addr=0x40000000
scriptaddr=0x40200000
pxefile_addr_r=0x40300000
kernel_addr_r=0x40400000
ramdisk_addr_r=0x44000000
boot_targets=qfw usb scsi virtio nvme dhcp
our_var=test
```

Now build the u-boot binary:

```bash
make -j$(nproc) ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=.<toolchain_prefix_path>
```

### 5.1. Making an environment file

Let's say we want to add these variables:

```text
var=test
varboot=test
```

Now the u-boot cannot understand raw file, the env must be in the u-boot env format. So we make text file `my-uboot.env.txt` that contains those variables. To convert the file into uboot format, we use the uboot tool `mkenvimage`. Note that the environment file size MUST match the config `CONFIG_ENV_SIZE`, for example:

```text
CONFIG_ENV_SIZE=0x40000
```

Now you have to create an env file and fill it up until reach 0x40000, this is done by `mkenvimage` tool:

```bash
tools/mkenvimage -s 0x40000 -o my-uboot.env my-uboot.env.txt
```

### 5.2. Running QEMU

We need to emulate a block device `virtio`, Let make an image first:

```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=boot.img bs=1k count=20480
mkfs.ext4 boot.img
```

Now mounting it into a mount point and copy the `my-uboot.env` to it:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/boot
sudo mount -o loop boot.img /mnt/boot
sudo cp my-uboot.env /mnt/boot/
sudo sync
sudo umount /mnt/boot
```

Now we have a drive image. Let's run qemu with u-boot and virtio:

```bash
qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -cpu cortex-a53 -nographic -bios u-boot.bin -drive file=boot.img,if=none,format=raw,id=hd0 -device virtio-blk-device,drive=hd0
```

Enter the u-boot console, and print environment:

```bash
U-Boot 2025.04-01160-g71f497a6d390-dirty (Apr 19 2025 - 23:41:00 -0800)

DRAM:  128 MiB
Core:  51 devices, 14 uclasses, devicetree: board
Flash: 64 MiB
Loading Environment from EXT4... 

=> print
ethaddr=52:54:00:12:34:56
fdtcontroladdr=4659adc0
var=test
varboot=test

Environment size: 73/262140 bytes
```

You see our environment is actually there along with some variables that is set by u-boot itself, and because there's no `bootcmd`, u-boot doesn't automatically boot. In case the env file is not there, default built-in variables will be load. You might see full the list with our new variable `our_var=test` like this:

```bash
=> print
print
arch=arm
baudrate=115200
board=qemu-arm
board_name=qemu-arm
boot_targets=qfw usb scsi virtio nvme dhcp
bootcmd=bootflow scan -lb
bootdelay=2
cpu=armv8
ethaddr=52:54:00:12:34:56
fdt_addr=0x40000000
fdt_high=0xffffffff
fdtcontroladdr=4659adc0
initrd_high=0xffffffff
kernel_addr_r=0x40400000
loadaddr=0x40200000
our_var=test
preboot=usb start
pxefile_addr_r=0x40300000
ramdisk_addr_r=0x44000000
scriptaddr=0x40200000
stderr=serial,vidconsole
stdin=serial,usbkbd
stdout=serial,vidconsole
usb_ignorelist=0x1050:*,
vendor=emulation

Environment size: 527/262140 bytes
```
