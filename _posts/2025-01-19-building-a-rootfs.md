Building a simple rootfs with busybox

```bash
cd busybox/
make -j4 ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=../toolchain/bin/aarch64-none-linux-gnu- defconfig
make -j4 ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=../toolchain/bin/aarch64-none-linux-gnu- menuconfig
make -j4 ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=../toolchain/bin/aarch64-none-linux-gnu-
make -j4 ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=../toolchain/bin/aarch64-none-linux-gnu- install
cd ../
mkdir -p rootfs/{bin,sbin,etc,proc,sys,usr/{bin,sbin}}
cp -av busybox/_install/* rootfs/
cd rootfs
ln -sf bin/busybox init
mkdir -p etc/init.d/
cat > etc/init.d/rcS << EOF
mount -t sysfs none /sys
mount -t proc none /proc
EOF
chmod -R 777 etc/init.d/rcS
find . -print0 | cpio --null -ov --format=newc | gzip -9 > ../rootfs.cpio.gz
```

How does it work?
=================

The kernel has currently 3 ways to mount the root filesystem:

a) all required device and filesystem drivers compiled into the kernel, no
   initrd.  init/main.c:init() will call prepare_namespace() to mount the
   final root filesystem, based on the root= option and optional init= to run
   some other init binary than listed at the end of init/main.c:init().

b) some device and filesystem drivers built as modules and stored in an
   initrd.  The initrd must contain a binary '/linuxrc' which is supposed to
   load these driver modules.  It is also possible to mount the final root
   filesystem via linuxrc and use the pivot_root syscall.  The initrd is
   mounted and executed via prepare_namespace().

c) using initramfs.  The call to prepare_namespace() must be skipped.
   This means that a binary must do all the work.  Said binary can be stored
   into initramfs either via modifying usr/gen_init_cpio.c or via the new
   initrd format, an cpio archive.  It must be called "/init".  This binary
   is responsible to do all the things prepare_namespace() would do.

   To maintain backwards compatibility, the /init binary will only run if it
   comes via an initramfs cpio archive.  If this is not the case,
   init/main.c:init() will run prepare_namespace() to mount the final root
   and exec one of the predefined init binaries.
